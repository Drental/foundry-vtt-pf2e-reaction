## To contribute translations

To help translate an existing language, or to add support for a new language, do one of the following:
* Use the [gitlocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/8666) to translate the project into your language. [See their instructions](https://docs.gitlocalize.com/how_to_contribute.html) or for a new language, ask for it to be added on the discord so you can translate it on gitlocalize.
* Send me a completed translation file for your language and ask me to add it to the system (e.g. by copying en.json to xx.json (replacing xx with the language code of the language you want to translate to), and translating only the text to the right of the colon for each line)
* If you are comfortable with Github, after translating, instead of just sending the file, make a Pull Request
